### üöß In Progress: Workforce Management Module

#### Current Priority: Complete Remaining Workforce Components
With User Management now complete, the focus shifts to implementing the remaining workforce management components to complete the core FSM functionality.

#### Workforce Module Components Progress
1. **Users** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (v2.3.0) - Full CRUD functionality with comprehensive documentation
2. **Crew** - ‚è≥ **NEXT PRIORITY** - Team and group management for field operations
3. **Equipment** - üìã **PLANNED** - Equipment inventory, assignments, and tracking
4. **Time Off** - üìã **PLANNED** - Leave management and scheduling system
5. **Trips** - üìã **PLANNED** - Basic trip planning and route management
6. **Auto Log** - üìã **PLANNED** - Automated time tracking and logging

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Core vs Plugin Classification**: 
  - Core Features (main system): Users (‚úÖ), Crew, Equipment, Time Off
  - Plugin Candidates: Trips (route optimization), Auto Log (GPS tracking)
- **Database Design**: Create models for crew, equipment, trips, time_off
- **UI Design**: Follow existing Work Order Management and User Management patterns
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints consistent with existing modules

### üìã Planned Features (Post-Workforce)

#### Plugin System Implementation
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular system for extensibility
- **Core vs Plugin Migration**: Move billing, advanced estimates to plugins
- **Third-party Integrations**: QuickBooks, Stripe, GPS services
- **Plugin Management**: Settings interface for enable/disable

## Recommended Development Priority

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Complete all workforce management functionality

#### Week 1: Database and Models
1. Create workforce-related database migrations
2. Implement Models (CrewModel, EquipmentModel, TripModel, TimeOffModel)
3. Set up basic CRUD operations
4. Create API endpoints

#### Week 2: Controllers and Views
1. Implement WorkforceController with all submodules
2. Create responsive UI for all workforce pages
3. Integrate with existing navigation system
