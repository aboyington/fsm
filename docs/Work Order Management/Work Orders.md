# Work Orders Module

## Overview
The Work Orders module manages the formal work authorizations and job management for field service operations.

## Features
- Create and manage work orders from accepted estimates or direct requests
- Track work order progress through various stages
- Assign technicians and resources to work orders
- Link to customer information, assets, and service history
- Generate work order documentation for technicians

## Statuses
- **Draft**: Initial state when work order is being prepared
- **Open**: Work order is ready for assignment and scheduling
- **In Progress**: Work is currently being performed
- **Completed**: Work has been finished successfully
- **Cancelled**: Work order has been cancelled
- **On Hold**: Work order is temporarily paused

- `estimate_id` - Link to originating estimate (nullable)
- `request_id` - Link to originating request (nullable)
- `client_id` - Customer company
- `contact_id` - Primary contact for the work
- `asset_id` - Asset being serviced (nullable)
- `assigned_to` - Technician assigned to the work
- `territory_id` - Service territory
- `priority` - Work priority level
- `status` - Current work order status
- `description` - Detailed work description
- `notes` - Additional notes and instructions
- `scheduled_date` - Planned work date
- `completed_date` - Actual completion date
- `estimated_hours` - Estimated time to complete
- `actual_hours` - Actual time spent
- `created_by` - User who created the work order
- `updated_by` - User who last updated the work order
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp
- `deleted_at` - Soft delete timestamp

### Priority Levels
- **Low**: Non-urgent work
- **Medium**: Standard priority
- **High**: Important work requiring attention
- **Urgent**: Critical work requiring immediate attention

## API Endpoints

### RESTful Routes
- `GET /work-orders` - List all work orders
- `GET /work-orders/create` - Show create form
- `POST /work-orders/store` - Create new work order
- `GET /work-orders/view/{id}` - View work order details
- `GET /work-orders/edit/{id}` - Get work order for editing
- `POST /work-orders/update/{id}` - Update work order
- `POST /work-orders/delete/{id}` - Soft delete work order

### AJAX Endpoints
- `GET /work-orders/edit/{id}` - Returns JSON data for editing
- `POST /work-orders/update-status/{id}` - Quick status updates
- `GET /work-orders/technician/{id}` - Get work orders for specific technician

## User Interface

### Main View
- Empty state with professional illustration when no work orders exist
- Comprehensive data table with sorting, filtering, and search
- Quick action buttons for common operations
- Status indicators with color coding

### Create/Edit Modal
- Two-column responsive layout
- Client and contact selection with dynamic loading
- Asset selection filtered by client
- Territory and technician assignment
- Priority and status management
- Date and time scheduling
- Rich text areas for descriptions and notes

### View Details
- Complete work order information display
- Related records (estimate, request, appointments)
- Action history and audit trail
- Quick actions for status changes

## Business Logic

### Work Order Creation
1. Can be created from accepted estimates
2. Can be created directly from requests
3. Can be created independently
4. Auto-assigns territory based on client location
5. Sets default priority based on request type

### Status Workflow
```
Draft → Open → In Progress → Completed
         ↓
      Cancelled
         ↓
      On Hold → Open
```

### Validation Rules
- **Required Fields**: client_id, description, priority, status
- **Date Validation**: scheduled_date must be in the future for new orders
- **User Validation**: assigned_to must be valid technician
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced business rules for status changes
