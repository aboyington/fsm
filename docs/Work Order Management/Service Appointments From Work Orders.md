## Create Service Appointments     

Service appointments are jobs created for carrying out the services in a work order. These service appointments are assigned to field agents or crew who will then render the services at the contact location. You can create as many service appointments as the services in the work order.   

  

Appointments can be created from the  **Work Orders** module or the [**Service Appointments**](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/fsm/work-order-management/articles/service-appointments) module.

  

To create a service appointment:  

1. Select **Work Orders** from the **Work Order Management** menu and click the work order you want to add the service appointment to.  
    
2. Select the **Appointments** tab and click **Create Appointment**.  
    
3. Enter the following details, then click **Schedule**:  
    

4. A **Summary** for the service appointment
5. The values for **Scheduled Start Date Time** and ****Scheduled** End Date Time**.  
    The **Scheduled Start Date Time** and **Scheduled End Date Time** should be within the same day. Use [multi-day scheduling](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/fsm/work-order-management/articles/service-appointments#Multi-day_appointments) to schedule an appointment spanning multiple days.
6. A **Field Agent** or a **Crew**
