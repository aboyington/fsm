# Work Order Management - Overview

## Introduction

The Work Order Management section is a comprehensive system for managing the complete lifecycle of field service operations. This module handles everything from initial customer requests to completed service reports and recurring maintenance schedules.

## Module Architecture

The Work Order Management section consists of six interconnected modules:

1. **Requests** - Initial customer inquiries and service requests
2. **Estimates** - Cost proposals and quotations for requested services
3. **Work Orders** - Formal work authorizations and job management
4. **Service Appointments** - Scheduling and calendar management
5. **Service Reports** - Completion documentation and reporting
6. **Scheduled Maintenances** - Recurring maintenance automation

## Workflow Integration

### Standard Service Workflow
```
Request → Estimate → Work Order → Service Appointment → Service Report
```

### Maintenance Workflow
```
Scheduled Maintenance → Work Order → Service Appointment → Service Report
```
