# Manage Assets

An **Asset** refers to a part instance that has been sold to customers and is now owned by them. Consider a company selling air conditioners. To provide after-sales support like warranty service or repairs, they would need to keep track of their sold products. With the Assets module, you can manage the assets associated with a customer and create work orders for these assets.
